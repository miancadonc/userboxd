# Userboxd

This gem allows the user to scrape the popular film social media site letterboxd to retrieve and compare user profile data. The gem is basically intended to be a fun tool for comparing the film viewing tendencies of a few friends. It has the ability to get and list all of the films that a user has rated on the site, and it can compare two users directly to display who has rated more movies, and, when given a particular movie, can display which user rated the movie more highly.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'userboxd'
